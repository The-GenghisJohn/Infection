Infection is a multiplayer gamemode for Gary's Mod.

The goal of the game is to not be the one infected. As an infected, you must find uninfected players and pass on your infection. While infected, your infection timer will wind down. The game ends when one player's infection timer hits Zero. The winner is declared by whoever had the highest infection timer.

Being infected is no fun, as such, Players will want to hide from the infected. This is no good. Charge up your "Gross noise" ability and uninfected players will be compelled to voice their disgust.

### Planned Features
 - [ ] Alternate infection types (Better faster stronger)
 - [ ] Secondary Attack that slows those who walk through it (think tar trap)
 - [ ] Infection time pickups (get those points back!)
 - [ ] Better infection animations (do something while frozen other than stand there)
 - [ ] Web integration (global scoreboards!)
